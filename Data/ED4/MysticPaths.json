Two successes conveys more specific emotions or allows for general conversations, such as fear of Horrors or giving tomorrow’s weather forecast. Three successes expresses complex, even conflicting feelings and the relations between them or allows them to convey detailed information, such as indicating how to mix the red body paint used by their clan. Four successes allows any topic to be expressed. Conveying messages takes as long as speaking them, so a wind dance may require longer than one round to perform. Conveying emotions does not convey the character’s actual emotions, but fakes the emotion and can be used to mislead onlookers. To read a windling’s flight, the adept makes a Wind Dance (6) test.

The text remains encrypted until the “key” is applied to reveal the text. The Veiled Cipher result determines the Sensing Difficulty of the illusion. While the illusion may be obvious, piercing it is difficult as it actively confuses the reader, confounding them and their efforts. This knack affects up to Read and Write Languages pages of text and does not have to affect all the text on a page. This knack can be applied to text which is encrypted through means other than illusion, providing an additional layer of protection. The “key” can be nearly anything, such as a written symbol on the page (requiring a matching or complementary symbol to be written), spoken phrase, object, etc. The nature of the key is typically indicated by an unencrypted code on the page or pre-arranged between sender and receiver.

For each additional success against the target, they learn the following information in order: 1) their direction from the adept, 2) their distance from the adept, 3) their race and gender, 4) their general emotional state, and 5) their general health. This talent lasts for Sense Captive rank minutes and may be maintained by spending 1 Strain when it is about to expire. To make a new test, the talent must be allowed to expire, then used again. This does not automatically detect targets using illusions to conceal their nature even if successful against the target’s Mystic Defense, but is a Sensing test against the illusion. "},

When attacked in close combat, the adept makes a Cast Net test against the Attack test result. If successful, the adept has parried the attack. Cast Net can be used Cast Net rank times per round, but only one attempt per Attack test. The adept cannot use Cast Net if they are Blindsided or Surprised by the Attacker. Cast Net cannot be used against the same attack as Avoid Blow, Riposte, or other similar active defenses. For two additional successes, the adept also Entangles the opponent. The Entangling Difficulty is equal to the Cast Net Step. If the adept holds on to the net, they gain their Cast Net rank as a bonus to Disarm tests against the opponent’s weapon used to make the attack. The adept can only hold on to one net at a time and cannot use Cast Net to parry if the adept is holding onto a net entangling something. Any net of convenient size can be used with Cast Net. Nets can be improvised from items such as cloaks or blankets, but Cast Net tests with these are made at a -2 penalty. "},

The spell has no effect on dragons. Once all spell threads are woven, the magician speaks the True Name, makes a Spellcasting (6) test, and pays five Karma Points (these are not added to the Spellcasting test). If successful, the number of successes determines the number of days in the future and past the magician can foresee. The magician may ask one question regarding the Namegiver and their associated actions; it cannot be about beliefs, feelings, intentions, plans, etc. The vision provided focuses on the relevant information intended by the magician, and does not dwell on irrelevant interactions - these are unimportant to the Namegiver’s pattern. This spell does not reveal any unknown True Names, but if the answer has relevant True Names the magician knows, they are revealed. For example, if Hessia poses the question, “Who did Jascen associate with in the past three days?”, then anyone whose True Name Hessia knows has their identity revealed, and anyone whose True Name she does not know is described as seen in that period, but their identity is not revealed. The magician may only cast this spell once per moon cycle (tracking from full moon to full moon) per True Name. Each casting against a different target within the same moon cycle requires a cumulative additional success with no additional benefit."},

This spell summons a group of beast spirits to imbue a hunt with their power. The Shaman performs a ritual (all targets must be present) to summon the spirits, each thread takes 10 minutes to weave, and a thread must be woven for each target. Each ritual is unique to the spellcaster and is influenced by generations of Shaman before them, but is tailored to the particular group of spirits they wish to summon. After completing the ritual, the Shaman makes a Spellcasting (6) test. If successful, the Shaman pays one Karma Point for each participant, and each participant pays one karma. The Shaman may pay the participant’s Karma Point if they are unable. The Karma Points do not improve the Spellcasting test. The Shaman then chooses three of the following virtues: Aggression: +2 to Attack and Damage tests Courage: +2 to Initiative, Social Defense, and tests to resist fear effects Mysticism: +2 to Mystic Armor and Mystic Defense Protection: +2 to Knockdown tests, Physical Armor, and Wound Threshold, Spirituality: +2 to Spellcasting, Thread Weaving, and Effect tests Swiftness: +2 to Initiative, Movement Rate, and Physical Defense Each affected target within the area of effect at the time of casting receives the benefits for the duration of the spell and takes on some of the traits of the summoned beast spirits. This spell may affect a maximum number of targets equal to the magician’s Spellcasting rank and may only be cast once every 5 days (failed castings count against this limit). This spell may not be learned by non-Shaman adepts."}
