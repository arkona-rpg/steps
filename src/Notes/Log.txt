β06 (20/10 2020):

- The way Discipline stat bonuses work completely rewritten; the option to have all stat bonuses from Disciplines and Paths stack added
- Fixed several bugs and problems that arose from taking stuff linked to Disciplines, then removing that Discipline. Any Knacks, Spells and Paths the Character is no longer qualified for should be removed automatically

- Thread items can now provide a blanket bonus to Threadweaving (all styles)

β04 (12/9 2020):
- Bit of improvement in the error handling when loading a character file
- Input Validation poked a little at. Perhaps this is enough =P
- When switching away from a spellcaster discipline, don't leave 'dead' spells lying around. Same with Knacks no longer qualified for. OK
- For some reason, Matrices don't show? Do now; it was a couple self-closed tags (o:
- Astral-sensitive Eye and other blood charms seem to not show their modifiers right. Now I wonder if they calculate =P (Jonathans's player) OK
- Categories for spells, equipment optional Talents and Knacks
- Suggest feature for Artisan and Knowledge skills; I've rounded out the lists a lot.

- Air Sailor Circle 15 Talent fixed (Sebastian)
- Dwarven carry capacity doesn't work (reported by someone =P) OK
- Matrices gained from Thread Items don't show their rank correctly in the Talents list. They DO show it correctly on the Matrix card, and the card  seems to work. Was a curly brackets issue - Fixed. Oddly enough, Other Talents gained through Items do Not seem to register the rank right? No; other Talents gained through Items have a modifier to the talent Step, not a Rank per se. I now wonder if I should include a bonus column too, and add even More numbers to the sheet =P
