This can be used to either reaffirm the questor’s connection and devotion or seek guidance from the Passion. Reaffirming their devotion grants the questor Devotion Points equal to their tier (1 for Follower, 2 for Adherent, or 3 for Exemplar). When reaffirming their connection, the questor may also increase the rank of a devotion as described under Advancing Devotions, p. 134. Alternately, the questor can seek guidance of a general or specific nature, such as what the Passion wants the questor to do, or guidance on how to proceed with something related to the Passion’s ideals. The questor makes a Questor (10) test modified by the Astral Sensing Table (Player’s Guide, p. 209); the difficulty for questors of Mad Passions is not modified. The Passion provides some form of insight for each success, whether this reveals the ideal the Passion wishes to see lived out, the direction the questor should travel, a clue the Passion will use to identify the nature of the quest, etc. Alternatively, the Passion may allow the questor to ask one question per success (or success remaining if insight was provided). These questions must be directly related to the Passion’s ideals. This information should be useful but is often cryptic. The questor’s other devotions cannot advance beyond their Questor rank. The questor’s maximum Devotion Points is their Questor rank × 10."},

If successful, the target becomes obsessed with the burgeoning piece of art and the questor by extension. For each success, non- adepts gain a +2 bonus and adepts gain a +1 bonus to all tests directly related to completing the work. Their focus on the art distracts the target from other tasks, resulting in a -1 penalty to tests unrelated to producing the work.

The questor makes an Awaken the Wood (6) test. If successful, the questor issues a simple instruction which is followed for one minute per success. The plant is not intelligent and cannot discern between Namegivers, only questor and not questor. If the plant is currently under another’s influence, the Difficulty is equal to the Mystic Defense or Action Step of the other party, whichever is most appropriate. This devotion affects up to rank × 2 cubic yards of plants, whether it is one or all the plants in the area. Only the parts of a plant in the affected area respond, thus a partially affected plant cannot move its entire form but will move the affected parts. This devotion is most commonly used to move plants to new locations or have them grow in a particular fashion. However, it can also be used to interfere with opponents. This could create an area that is difficult to traverse (halving Movement Rate), harass anyone within (inflicting Harried), or attempting to knockdown. If this kind of interaction requires a test, use the Awaken the Wood Step as the Action Step against an appropriate Defense (typically Physical). Affected plants cannot inflict damage but can make life difficult. Alternately, the animated plants can be used to aid, eliminating movement penalties due to plant growth, creating shelter or cover, assisting in climbing, etc. If the plants are assisting in the form of a bonus (e.g. assisting climbers), make an Awaken the Wood (6) test, with each success providing a +2 bonus."},

The questor can nominate a champion to fight in their place. The questor makes a Challenge of Dis test against the target leader’s Social Defense. If successful, the target may accept or ignore the challenge. Both sides may negotiate terms or commence fighting immediately. The talent provides an unspoken connection to immediately communicate each side’s intentions. If the target refuses the challenge, both they and their troops become demoralized and suffer a -2 penalty to all Defenses and tests for each success on the Challenge of Dis test for rank hours. If the target accepts, the two champions fight. After the fight, the victor makes an Intimidate test against the highest Social Defense of the opposing side, with a bonus equal to the Questor rank, Circle, or equivalent of the defeated opponent. Each success on this test gives members of the opposing side a -2 penalty to all tests made against the victor and their allies for 24 hours. Anyone attempting to interfere with the challenge immediately causes their side to lose the challenge (regardless of which champion was interfered with) and, in addition to the other penalties for losing, is Harried for 24 hours.

This command is understood even if the targets do not speak the language used. The questor makes a Compel test against the highest Social Defense in the target group, adepts gain +5 Social Defense against this test. If successful, the targets must obey the command and suffer a -1 penalty to Willpower tests for each additional success (this is not cumulative with penalties from Submit). The command must be phrased as a single, simple sentence. For example, “Tie yourselves up and come with me,” or “Attack your friends,” represent valid commands. A command such as “Kill them!” is too vague, though “Kill everyone!” would be understood and obeyed. Questors can use Compel to make people do things they would not normally do, even harm loved ones. If a target is commanded to directly harm themselves or perform an obviously suicidal act, such as remain still while stabbed repeatedly, the target may make a Willpower test against the questor’s Compel Step as a Free action at the beginning of each round. If successful, they throw off the effects of the devotion and may act normally. This devotion lasts for rank rounds. If the necessary control for this devotion is gained through Submit and the duration for Submit expires before Compel does, Compel immediately ends."},

The questor makes a Jaspree’s Solace test against a Difficulty Number determined by the region type. Regardless of success or failure, the questor suffers Warping as though they cast a Fifth Circle spell using raw magic (Player’s Guide, p. 261), but there is no danger of a Horror mark. Each success transfers one Corruption Point from the location’s pattern to the questor’s pattern. The questor must use all available successes. Corruption Points gained through this devotion are temporary and should be tracked separately. One temporary Corruption Point is removed every new moon. However, temporary Corruption Points can still overload the questor’s pattern and cause them to become corrupted (Gamemaster’s Guide, p. 456). If the questor’s total Corruption Points (including temporary points) exceeds the Corruption Value, they become corrupted and the temporary Corruption Points become normal Corruption Points and are not removed at each new moon. This devotion can be used once per day. Each location has Corruption Points based on the region type and size. The ranges presented in the table reflect the typical range of Corruption Points in a location up to a half-mile square area. When the Corruption Points in a location are reduced to the range of a lesser region type, the location shifts to the new type over the next 28 days. Questors of Jaspree are careful when using this devotion and almost always work in groups to shoulder the burden together. While the spread of corruption outside of a Horror’s presence isn’t well understood, there is evidence Tainted and Corrupt locations spread their corruption to adjacent areas. Creating an Open location as a bastion within a heavily corrupted area can be done but requires constant maintenance to prevent it from becoming Tainted again. If the questor has a thread tied to a pattern item for the location, they gain additional successes on a successful test: one for a minor pattern item, two for a major pattern item, and three for a core pattern item."},

This can include selling a family heirloom, prized possession, convincing a reluctant bodyguard to go on a dangerous journey, or simply separating a notorious miser from their coin. The questor makes a Let’s Make a Deal test against the highest Social Defense among the targets, +1 per additional target. If successful, the targets are willing to make a deal, but it typically starts at least double a reasonable price and goes up as the target attaches more sentimental or practical value to it (with a considerable amount of sentimental value attached to their life and livelihood). Each additional success gives the questor +2 to an ensuing Haggle test. Once engaged, the questor must make the purchase or fall into severe disfavor with Chorrolis. This devotion has no effect on objects which are truly priceless, such as thread items with a thread from the owner attached, pattern items, etc., or if another emotion of much greater importance to the target takes precedence, such as convincing a parent to abandon their child. This devotion cannot be used for tasks which are clearly suicidal, unless the target is truly willing to face certain death for enough money. This can be used once per week per target; if the devotion fails against a given target, it cannot be used on them for another month. Let’s Make a Deal is exceptionally powerful and can force targets into do- ing things they do not want to do. There are prohibitions along with this in an attempt to enforce the general idea: this cannot be used to arbitrarily ruin a target or as a creative way to kill them. Chorrolis lends this power to its quest- ors and actually wants to see this be used as a positive force to encourage trade. If a questor abuses this power, Chorrolis will take it away."},

Adepts gain +5 to Social Defense against this devotion. If successful, the targets are compelled to obey the questor. While they are not mindless and cannot be compelled to perform an obviously suicidal action, targets must obey both the letter and the spirit of the command. The command cannot be to fight, as this is not a menial task. A target may attempt to resist the devotion once per day with a Willpower test against the questor’s Living Death Step. If successful, the target must still perform the menial task, but need only follow the letter of the command, not the spirit. For example, a prisoner commanded to dig can do so in a location which actively hinders their captors. Only when the devotion ends or the questor commands them to stop can the affected group cease the activity. This devotion lasts for eight hours plus an additional hour per rank. Affected targets suffer no ill effects while performing their task but may suffer damage from overexertion. When the duration ends, each target is subject to a Damage test equal to the number of hours over eight they worked. No armor reduces the damage, and the character takes Wounds if appropriate. Every five days a target is affected by this devotion and do not successfully rebel with a Willpower test, the target suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to Willpower tests and Social Defense. These penalties disappear at a rate of 1 every five days they have not been successfully targeted by this devotion. Successful Willpower tests do not reduce the penalties, just prevent their accumulation."},

Non-Namegivers gain +5 to their Mystic Defense against this test. If the building is home to a Namegiver within the barrier, the questor gains +5 to Seal Home tests.
