So, if I was, almost completely hypothetically, a few weeks into making a character handler program that would be system agnostic, made to be relatively easily adaptable to all games using the CoreStep system, and relatively translation-friendly, what would the interest level be in this? 
I find myself in need of someone to spar ideas with, and someone who would be willing to assist with data entry, plase PM me if you're interested.

I am slowly inching my way towards producing a character editor that is going to be:

- Fairly simple to adapt to house rules (because I have a few)
- Will do Earthdawn 4 and 1879 out of the box, comes prepared to accept adaption to other CoreStep games
- Is translation friendly, 
- And if you know html, you can make your own character sheet for use in it. 

This is a slow burn project for reasons I don't feel like coming into here, so it's still months from even Beta time, but what I have now makes me feel rather confident that I can Do this thing (o: 

I find myself in need of someone to spar ideas with, someone willing and able to wrangle data into json for it, and some beta testors down the line. 

If you're interested, drop me a line, and please note that I'm not in a position to pay anything but gratitude and a namedrop for your time.
